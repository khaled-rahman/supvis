# Graph Visualization via Embedding: Supervised vs. Unsupervised Approaches
We empirically show that the supervised graph embedding can generate better quality visualization than unsupervised methods. Different aesthetic measures support our prior statement.

## Run Different  Embedding Techniques
To generate embeddings for BatchLayout and GraphSAGE, go to corresponding folder and execute corresponding commands. Instructions are described in a README file. To generate embedding for DeepWalk and HARP download corresponding source codes and follow the instructions described in README files. We provide the embeddings generated by all tools inside the `embeddings` folder.

Download links of DeepWalk and HARP are given as follows:
[DeepWalk][https://github.com/phanein/deepwalk]
[HARP][https://github.com/GTmac/HARP]

## Generate 2D visualizations of embeddings
To generate 2D visualization for a batchlayout embedding, please run the following command:
```
# python -u vismeasures.py datasets/cora.mtx 1 embeddings/cora_batchlayout_128.embd 128 datasets/cora.nodes.labels corabatchlayout
```
Here, first parameter is the input graph, second parameter is the type of embedding (1 for GraphSAGE/BatchLayout/DeepWalk, any other value for HARP), third parameter is the absolute path of embedding file, fourth parameter is the dimension of embedding, fifth parameter represents the ground truth labels for the vertices in input graph, then last parameter is the name of output visualization file.

To generate 2D visualization for a GraphSAGE embedding, please run the following command:
```
# python -u vismeasures.py datasets/cora.mtx 1 embeddings/cora_graphsage_128.embd 128 datasets/cora.labels.pg coragraphsage
```

## Find the value of aesthetic measures
When we generate 2D visualization, it also reports silhouette and Davies-Bouldin measures. To get $$Q_{local}$$ and $$Q_{global}$$ measures, users need to have following R packages: `knitr`, `Rtsne`, `coRanking`,and `dimRed`. Then, go inside `qmeasures` folder and run the following:
```
Rscript test.R
```
